# E-Learning, Real-Time Chat, and Virtual E-Banking System

This repository hosts a versatile web application that seamlessly integrates three fundamental components: E-Learning, Real-Time Chat, and Virtual E-Banking. The frontend is crafted using React.js, harnessing the power of various packages and libraries such as MUI, base64, date-fns, and more.

## Project Overview

### E-Learning System

The E-Learning system offers a user-friendly platform where users can explore, filter, and search for courses tailored to their interests. Key features include:

- **Filtering Courses:** Users can efficiently filter courses based on categories, difficulty levels, and other criteria.

- **Searching Courses:** A powerful search functionality enables users to quickly find courses using keywords.

- **Buying Courses:** Seamless purchase options allow users to buy courses, providing a secure and user-friendly transaction process.

- **Studying Courses by Module:** Courses are organized into modules, and users can progress through each module with access to online or offline video content.

### Real-Time Chat System

The Real-Time Chat system fosters instant communication and collaboration among users, including:

- **Live Chat:** Users can engage in real-time chat with peers, teachers, or fellow course participants.

- **Discussion Forums:** Dedicated forums for each course facilitate discussions, question-and-answer sessions, and collaboration.

### Virtual E-Banking System

The Virtual E-Banking System streamlines financial transactions within the platform, offering:

- **Secure Money Transactions:** Users can securely conduct transactions related to course purchases and other services.

- **Integration with E-Learning:** Seamlessly integrates with the E-Learning system for course-related financial transactions.

### Admin Dashboard for E-Learning System

The Admin Dashboard provides administrators with powerful tools to manage and monitor the E-Learning system:

- **User Management:** Admins can manage user accounts, monitor user activity, and ensure a secure learning environment.

- **Course Management:** Effortlessly manage and update courses, including adding new content, updating modules, and more.

- **Financial Analytics:** Track financial transactions, revenue, and other analytics related to course purchases.
